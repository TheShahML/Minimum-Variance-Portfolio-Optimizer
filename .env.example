# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

# Paste your OpenAI API key here (remove the # to uncomment)
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to ".env" (without .example)
# 2. Uncomment the OPENAI_API_KEY line above
# 3. Replace "sk-your-api-key-here" with your actual API key
# 4. Save the file
#
# Note: The .env file is in .gitignore and will NOT be committed to version control
# This keeps your API key secure
